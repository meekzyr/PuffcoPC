# PuffcoPC

*Control your Puffco Peak Pro from your computer!*

## THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED
* You can now use the [official web app](https://puffco.app) on Google Chrome with a Bluetooth 4.0+ capable computer
* I have updated the project to support firmwares X (first firmware with auth) and AG (current as of 2/3/24) for proof of concept
